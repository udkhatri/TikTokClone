#TikTok Clone

I have made this TikTok clone jsut for educatonal purpose. 

[NOTE: UI IS HARD CODED. MAINLY POSTS MAY LOOK DIFFRENT IN YOUR DEVICE. TO ADJUST IT GO TO STYLES.JS IN POST AND ADJUST  "height: Dimensions.get('screen').height-45" to the appropriate value. ]


steps:

+ clone it on your local machine using git clone
+ yarn install
+ yarn start
+ yarn android

ðŸš« APP MIGHT NOT WORK PROPERLY ON IOS.
